	<h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>
	<p>Letâ€™s start closest to the present, to give some context. I studied for years in college to become a Telecommunications Engineer. I chose that career because it involved two fields I like: Electric Engineering and Communications. I ended up learning how to design communication systems, calculate orbits for satellites, finding optimal points for microwave communication, etc. Everything but something related to web development (which is now my forte).</p>
